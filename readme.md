# Naive Bayes Classification Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Naive Bayes classifier** using Python. The notebook walks through the fundamental steps of a supervised machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Overview

The notebook `25CS60R35_NaiveBayes.ipynb` covers:
- Loading and exploring a dataset
- Preprocessing data (handling missing values, encoding, normalization)
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Implementing **Naive Bayes** models using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluating classification performance with metrics and visualizations

## Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm:** Naive Bayes Classifier  
- **Variants Used:** GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB (as examples)  
- **Objective:** Classify samples into discrete categories based on probabilistic inference
